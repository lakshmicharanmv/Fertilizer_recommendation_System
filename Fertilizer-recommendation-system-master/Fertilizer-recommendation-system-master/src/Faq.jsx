      question: "What is the Fertilizer Recommendation System?",
      answer:
        "The Fertilizer Recommendation System is an interactive tool designed to provide tailored fertilizer recommendations based on specific inputs such as soil color, crop type, age of the crop, and fertilizer usage history. It aims to optimize crop growth and enhance agricultural productivity.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I use the Fertilizer Recommendation System?",
      answer:
        "To use the system, select your soil color, crop type, crop age, and indicate if youâ€™ve used any fertilizer in the past 10 days. The system will provide a tailored fertilizer recommendation to optimize crop growth.",
    },
    {
      question: "What types of crops does the system support?",
      answer:
        "The system supports a variety of crops including Maize, Sugarcane, Cotton, Tobacco, Paddy, Barley, Wheat, Millets, Oil seeds, Pulses, and Ground Nuts.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is the fertilizer recommendation calculated?",
      answer:
        "The system uses machine learning models trained on agricultural data to predict the most suitable fertilizer based on inputs like soil color, crop type, crop age, and fertilizer usage history.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get recommendations for crops not listed?",
      answer:
        "Currently, the system supports a fixed set of crops, but we are working to include more crop types in the future.",
    },

        "If you encounter an error, please check your inputs for accuracy. If the issue persists, feel free to contact support for further assistance.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the NPK ratio?",
      answer:
        "The NPK ratio represents the percentages of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) in a fertilizer. This ratio is essential for understanding the fertilizer's suitability for different crops.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I interpret the fertilizer recommendation?",
      answer:
        "The system provides a tailored fertilizer recommendation based on the selected inputs. The recommendation will include the type of fertilizer and the quantity to apply.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this system for organic farming?",

        "The frequency of fertilization depends on the crop type, soil health, and environmental conditions. The system will suggest the optimal fertilization schedule.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are there any guidelines for irrigating crops?",
      answer:
        "Yes, the system provides irrigation guidelines based on soil moisture and crop requirements.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I track the performance of my crops?",
      answer:
        "While the system does not directly track crop performance, it can help you make informed decisions to improve crop health and productivity.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is the Fertilizer Recommendation System free to use?",
      answer:
        "Yes, the Fertilizer Recommendation System is free to use for all users.",
